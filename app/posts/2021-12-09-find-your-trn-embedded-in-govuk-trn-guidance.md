We mocked up a version of the [GOV.UK TRN guidance page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn):

* as an entry point to the Find my TRN service in user research
* to get users to compare the online option to the phone support option.

## Changes to the original guidance

The reference to the TRA helpdesk email inbox has been replaced with a big green button which links to the Find your TRN online service.

The language has been changed from "request a reminder by email or phone" to "find out your TRN online or by phone".

The online option prompts the user to have their National Insurance number ready, although strictly speaking the service can be completed without it in many cases.
