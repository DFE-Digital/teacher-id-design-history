We initally [handled too many sign in attempts](/refer-serious-misconduct-by-a-teacher-in-england/handling-too-many-sign-in-attempts) by stopping users from signing in for 15 minutes, if they enter a confirmation code incorrectly 5 times.

But users are able to request another confirmation code and sign in.

So we changed the content to reflect this.
