Users can upload a single file to give details about:

- the teacher’s main duties
- the allegation
- any previous allegations

If a user clicks ‘Change’ from the check answers page, they’re taken back to the question that allows them to upload a file.

Unlike text boxes and radio buttons, file inputs cannot show the user’s current answer.

So we’ve added the currently uploaded file next to the file input.
