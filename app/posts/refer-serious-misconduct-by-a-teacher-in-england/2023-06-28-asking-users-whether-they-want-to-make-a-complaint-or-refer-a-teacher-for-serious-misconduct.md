title: Asking users whether they want to make a complaint or refer a teacher for serious misconduct
date: 2023-06-28

The service receives a lot of referrals which are not about serious misconduct.

The service cannot deal with these referrals. The people making them should instead complain to the school or another organisation such as their local council.

We currently ask users whether they’ve made a complaint. If they say no then they can continue anyway. We know that:

- 12% of submitted referrals are from users who say they have not made a complaint
- 26% of users who initially say they have not made a complaint go back and change their answer - this includes both submitted and unsubmitted referrals

We need to do research but we think that users make incorrect referrals because they:

- are already in the referrals service, making it easier to continue rather than change to another service
- can see a clear route to referring a teacher, whereas there are several ways to make a complaint
- do not understand the difference between referrals and complaints
- believe that they should make a referral as an ‘escalation’ if their complaint has not been upheld

We made changes to:

- make it clearer that referrals can only be used where there has been serious misconduct
- give examples of other organisations which users can complain to in addition to the school
- give routes for users to continue with a complaint

## What we’ve changed

We’ve removed the question asking whether the user has already “made a complaint to the school, school governors or your local council”.

We did this because the question:

- implied that if the user has made a complaint to one of the mentioned organisations then they do not need to make a further complaint
- gave the impression that a referral for misconduct is a way to escalate after making a complaint

We’ve replaced this question with a page asking the user whether they want to make a complaint or refer the teacher for serious misconduct.

The content of this page:

- gives examples of serious misconduct
- says that a teacher may be banned from teaching if they’re found guilty of serious misconduct
- says that the user should make a complaint instead if the allegation is not about serious misconduct
- uses the radio button hint text to give examples of organisations which the user could complain to

If the user says that they want to make a complaint, they’re taken to a page with links to:

- GOV.UK guidance about making a complaint
- the start page for making a complaint to the DfE

The guidance about making a complaint to schools or other organisations is complicated because it depends on the type of school and what they’re complaining about. We’ve decided to give only a small amount of information and let users find out more on GOV.UK.

We’ve included a green button linking to the DfE complaints process because we can clearly set out the conditions for people to use the process. Since there’s an online service, it gives users a clear onward journey from the page.

We’ve removed the page later in the journey which asked users to check that their allegation involves serious misconduct. This is because this is now covered by the new page asking them to decide between making a complaint or referral.

We’ve also made changes to the page which tells users about what will happen after they make a referral.

We rearranged the page so that it starts by telling users what information we’ll share with the teacher and their employer. We also now explain that the teacher may have to tell employers about the referral even if they are not found guilty of serious misconduct.

We’ve removed a line about keeping the referral on file for 50 years. This is unnecessary detail.

## Further considerations

We want to simplify the language used within the service. In particular we think that the word ‘prohibited’ will not be understood by some users. We plan to find out more about this through user research.
