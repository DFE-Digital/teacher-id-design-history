Some users upload files that contain viruses.

To prevent this from happening we’ll automatically check each file before including it in the referral that caseworkers receive.

## How it works

When a file is uploaded it’ll be checked to see if it contains a virus.

If the user clicks on the file while this is happening, they’ll be taken to a page that says the file is being checked.

If the user clicks on a file that’s been removed, they’ll be taken to a page that says the file has been removed.

If a file is removed the user will still be able to send their referral.

## Further considerations

If we find that a significant number of files are being removed by the virus checker, we’ll consider ways to:
- prevent users from sending their referral
- tell users that that they need to upload another file
