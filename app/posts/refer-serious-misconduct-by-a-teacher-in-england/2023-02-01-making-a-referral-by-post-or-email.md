title: Making a referral by post or email

We expect most users will make a referral using the online form.

But some users may still prefer to download a PDF form and send it by post or email.

So we added a section to the bottom of the start page to give users a way to do that.

## Further considerations

While working on this we noticed that:

- our service [starts on a Whitehall guidance page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-misconduct-referring-a-case) when it should be a mainstream page
- we have an additional [start page on our service domain](https://refer-serious-misconduct.education.gov.uk/start) which is redundant if the actual start page has the correct content

So weâ€™ll change this by:

- creating a mainstream start page on GOV.UK
- removing the start page on our service domain
