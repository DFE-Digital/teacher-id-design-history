title: Reducing the number of referrals that do not involve serious misconduct
date: 2023-05-12

---

Since launching the service on 6 March 2023, there’s been an increase in the number of referrals that are not serious misconduct. 
 
To reduce the number of referrals that do not involve serious misconduct, we’ve changed the: 
 
- ‘What the allegation is about’ page 
- exit page for when the allegation does not involve serious misconduct 


## Analysing the data

| Date range 	| Percentage of referrals that did not involve a teacher or were not serious misconduct 	| Percentage of referrals that did not involve a teacher 	| Percentage of referrals that were not serious misconduct 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 6 March 2022 to 5 March 2023 	| 31%<br>249 out of 838 	| 10%<br>88 out 838 	| 21%<br>161 out of 838 	|
| 6 March 2023 to 2 May 2023 	| 54%<br>176 out of 327 	| 11%<br>38 out 327 	| 42%<br>138 out 327 	|

We also know that 175 users out of 1555 selected ‘I’m not sure’ to ‘Does the allegation involve serious misconduct’. 
 
We’ll be reviewing the data to see if fewer users select ‘I’m not sure’.

## What we changed

### Changing the question page

At the moment:


- the page includes a broad definition of what serious misconduct involves and a long list of examples
- the h1 heading says ‘What the allegation is about’ which does not encourage the user to check the content on the page


So we changed:


- the h1 heading to ‘Check that your allegation involves serious misconduct’
- the examples to six short bullets


We also added content to make it clear that allegations that do not involve serious misconduct will not be investigated (‘for example, cases of incompetence’). 


We did not include examples of non-serious misconduct. This is because policy says every allegation must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, which makes defining non-serious misconduct difficult. We’ll consider adding examples in future iterations.
 
We currently ask ‘Does the allegation involve serious misconduct?’ which sounds general.


So we changed the question to ‘Does your allegation involve serious misconduct?’ to make it more specific.

### Changing the exit page

If the user selects ‘no’ to ‘Do you think the allegation involves serious’ misconduct, we take them to an exit page. 
 
At the moment:


- the h1 heading says ‘You need to report this misconduct somewhere else’ which only gives the user an action and not the reason why
- the content gives the user advice on how to make a complaint - but the user has already told us that they’ve made a complaint
 
So we changed:


- the h1 heading to ‘Your allegation is unlikely to be investigated because it is not serious misconduct’ to clearly explain the situation
- the content to give the user some clear next steps if they’re not satisfied their complaint has been resolved

## Further considerations

We’ll consider further content updates (for example, adding more guidance) if the data suggests this is needed.
