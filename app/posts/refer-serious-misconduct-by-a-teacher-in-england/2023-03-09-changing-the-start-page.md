Before users start using the service, they need to begin on a GOV.UK start page.

The start page needs to give the users just enough information to help them understand what the service does and if it’ll meet their needs.

So we worked with GDS to create a start page that meets the needs of both employers and members of the public.

## What problems we’re solving

### Multiple start points

At the moment, there are 4 different start points into the service:

- the mainstream GOV.UK page (for members of the public)
- the Whitehall guidance page (for employers)
- the Whitehall page linking to the PDF forms
- the start page included within the service itself

So we:

- removed the guidance page and the start page included within the service as they’re no longer needed
- kept the GOV.UK start page so that users have a single start point into the service
- kept the Whitehall page linking to the PDF forms - but changed the form names to make them consistent with the start page (‘teacher misconduct referral form’)

### Making the process clear

Before users make a referral, they need to complain to the school, college or local council first.

We include guidance within the service. But we do not want users to make a referral unless they’ve followed all other steps first.

So we decided to include this information on the start page too.

### Using the right language

We use the term ‘refer’ throughout the service as this follows legislation.

However, we know that members of the public are unlikely to use this term when searching for the service.

So we changed the H1 heading to ‘Report teacher serious misconduct in England’ to make it clear what the service is for and who can use it.


### How long it takes to use the service

Following the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-using-a-service/), we included information about how long it’ll take to complete a referral.

### Making a referral if you’re not in England

The service is for England only.

So we included links for users who need to report teacher misconduct in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

### Making a referral to Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)

If the alleged misconduct means there’s the risk of harm to a child, users need to make a referral to the DBS.

So we decided to highlight this to users as inset text at the start of the page.

### Other ways to report serious misconduct

We need to make the service accessible to users who want to make a referral by post or email instead.

So we included links to the PDF forms.

## Further considerations

In the future, we’ll consider:

- if the PDF forms should be hosted on GOV.UK, or eventually removed
- reviewing GDS analytics to make sure users are finding the page
- further user research to confirm users are clear what happens after they’ve made a referral
