We currently allow users to give feedback through the phase banner at the top of every page of the service.

The feedback form uses Google Forms to collect and store feedback. But since we no longer use Google Forms we have redesigned it to use GOV.UK styles.

We have also added a link to give feedback on the confirmation page.

## How it works

Clicking ‘feedback’ from the phase banner or ‘Give feedback about this service’ from the confirmation page will take users to the feedback form.

There are 3 questions:

### How satisifed are you with the service?

We’re asking for this so that we can track satisfaction score.

The options are:

- Very satisfied
- Satisfied
- Neither satisfied or dissatisfied
- Dissatisifed
- Very dissatisfied

### How can we improve the service?

We’re asking for this so that we can understand the problems users are having.

### Can we contact you about your feedback?

We’re asking for this so that we can contact users about their feedback and invite them to participate in user research.

The options are:

- Yes
- No

Selecting ‘Yes’ will reveal an email address field.

### Sending feedback

Clicking ‘Send feedback’ will take users to the confirmation page.

There’s a link to allow users to return to report serious misconduct start page.

## Further considerations

We’d like to consider:

- tracking which page the user was on when they went to give feedback
- whether we should connect the user to their feedback in order to add context to the feedback
