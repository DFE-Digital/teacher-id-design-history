At the moment, users confirm their agreement on a separate page after the check answers page. Users have to click a checkbox to confirm their agreement before sending their referral.

## What we changed

We moved the declaration to the bottom of the check answers page. This is helpful because the the user is asked to confirm that their answers are true to the best of their knowledge.

We removed the checkbox and changed the button to say ‘Agree and send referral’ to reduce effort. Also there’s some evidence that users have become so used to clicking a checkbox to agree, that they’ll click it without reading it.

We also made several changes to the content to be clearer and more concise.

## Further considerations

We want to clarify the meaning of permission in the line that says ‘you have permission from the relevant third parties for any evidence and supporting information to be shared, for example the police or DBS’.
