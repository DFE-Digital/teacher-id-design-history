title: Showing more appropriate content to employers when checking that they can use the service
date: 2023-07-12
---

At the start of the service we ask whether the user is making a referral as an employer or a member of the public.

We then ask employers whether:

•	their allegation is about a teacher
•	the teacher was employed in England
•	the allegation is about serious misconduct

The employer cannot continue to use the service if they say no to any of these questions.

Employers rarely say no to the questions. For example, only 6% of employers say that their allegation is not about serious misconduct.

The content which

## What we changed

We changed the content of the page which employers reach if their allegation is about a teacher.

We also changed the content of the page which employers reach after they say that their allegation is about serious misconduct.

### The allegation is not about a teacher

If the user’s allegation is not about a teacher, we currently suggest that they may want to make a complaint to the school instead. This is not appropriate for an employer, so we’ve changed the content.

## Telling an employer what will happen if they make a referral

After the user has confirmed that the allegation is about serious misconduct, we show a page which explains what will happen after they make a referral.

This page currently says that the user’s name and allegation will be sent to “the teacher and their employer”. This does not make sense if the user was the teacher’s employer.

We’ve changed the content to say “the teacher and any other employers”.

## Further considerations

We considered telling users to contact the police if a child is in danger. This is mentioned on the service start page.

However, we know that employers normally make a referral a long time after allegations were initially made. They will already have followed their complaints process and the teacher is unlikely to still be employed by them.
