A support agent that manually identifies a DQT record for a Get an identity user needs a way to link the two records.

In this design a support agent would:

- pick a user from the list of users
- choose to add a DQT record for that user
- lookup the DQT record by using their teacher reference number (TRN)
- check the record is correct (for example, they haven't typoâ€™d the TRN)
- add the record, or cancel the request

The user list will change, we still need to design a way to find users in support.

## Verifying a name by adding a DQT record

If the name we have is not verified, when a DQT record is added, if the names match, then we will mark the name as verified.

If the names do not match then there is no change.
