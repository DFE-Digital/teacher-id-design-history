We can share the data points we collect in DfE Identity account (DIA) with the consuming services we’re integrating with. We can pre-populate the consuming service’s personal details (name and date of birth) section, so the user does not have to enter them each time they use a teacher service. This data is available to consuming services but is read-only.

If their personal details have changed or are wrong, they can correct them in the DIA. By capturing name and date of birth centrally in DIA we’re reducing the chances of different services capturing different details.

### Access your teaching qualifications

We display the name held in DQT - this can be changed by accessing the DfE Identity account. This data is displayed as read-only.
