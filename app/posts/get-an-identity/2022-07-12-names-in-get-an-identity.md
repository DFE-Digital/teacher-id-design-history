title: Asking for people's names

Many people typically go by a name that is not the first name listed on their passport, driving license or birth certificate, for example: 

- someone with the legal name Jonathan Smith might be called John
- someone with the legal name Claire Sarah Jones might be called Sarah

Others have names which do not fit neatly into the first name / last name distinction, and they may use different variations of their first and last name in different contexts. 

To make life easier for these people, services should be clear when they are asking for a name which needs to match official documents. This includes cases where the service will create an official record, or match the user against one, for example:
- the service involves an identity check
- the service creates a new record in the Database of Qualified Teachers
- the service involves checking someone’s record in the Database of Qualified Teachers

Registering for an NPQ with Get an identity involves checking someone’s record in DQT and an identity check (performed by the NPQ provider), so we will specifically ask users for the name on their official documents. 

Get an identity also displays a user's personal information back to them next time they log in. We think that collecting the user’s preferred first name as well as the name on their official documents will make this a better experience, for example for someone who is transitioning and doesn't yet have official proof of their new name.

Both the user's preferred first name and the name on their official documents will be available to Register for an NPQ if they wish to pass them on to providers.
