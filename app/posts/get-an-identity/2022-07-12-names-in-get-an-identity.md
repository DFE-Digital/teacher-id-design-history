title: Asking for legal and preferred names in Get an identity

Many people typically go by a name that is not the first name listed their passport, driving license or birth certificate, for example: 

- someone with the legal name Jonathan Smith might be called John
- someone with the legal name Claire Sarah Jones might be called Sarah

Others have names which do not fit neatly into the first name / last name distinction, and they may use different variations of their first and last name in different contexts. 

To make life easier for these people, services should be clear about whether they need to know the user’s legal name, or simply what they prefer to be called, or both. 

Services need the user’s legal name when they are going to create an official record or rely on matching users against an official record, for example:

- the service involves an identity check
- the service creates a new record in the Database of Qualified Teachers
- the service involves checking someone’s record in the Database of Qualified Teachers

Get an identity to access Teacher Services involves checking someone’s record in DQT, so we will specifically ask for users’ legal names. Register for an NPQ involves an identity check (performed by the NPQ provider), which is also based on legal name. 

Get an identity also displays a users personal information back to them next time they log in. We think that collecting the user’s preferred first name as well as their legal name will make this a better experience, for example for someone who is transitioning and hasn’t yet changed their legal name.

This means that users’ preferred first names will also be available to Register for an NPQ if they wish to pass them on to providers alongside legal names.
