The first sprint of private beta mainly looked at the immediate content changes that we could make to the eligibility checker. 

Many would-be applicants simply aren’t eligible, so there’s a huge benefit to having an eligibility checker that lets people know within a few questions whether or not QTS is for them.

We began by making the first page of the eligibility checker more akin to the standard GOV.UK start page, although this depends on a larger piece of work to understand how people are finding their way to QTS.

We added a ‘state/territory’ question after ‘In which country are you currently recognised as a teacher?’ to cater for countries that have more than one competent authority. This applies to some countries that are currently eligible, but will also apply to some of the new ones.
