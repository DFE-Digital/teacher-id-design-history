### Background

Until now, the Apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England service has only asked for evidence of work history for some countries. Specifically, where the country or territory’s competent authority cannot confirm that the applicant’s employment record is free of sanctions (either in writing or online), we’ve asked for their work history instead.

Under the new regulations, work history is a requirement for all applicants. To get QTS, applicants must submit information about the teaching roles they’ve held.

### The new regulations

The new regulations require applicants to demonstrate both the nature and the duration of their work experience to date. Importantly, we need applicants to understand that we can only consider teaching roles that they’ve held since completing the qualification that led to them being recognised as a teacher. We cannot consider any teaching experience (paid or not) that they may have gained before, or during, that qualification.

### Types of role

When it comes to the specifics of the roles we’re interested in, every role must meet the following key requirements.

Each role must show that the applicant:

* worked unsupervised with children aged between 5 and 16 years
* was solely responsible for planning, preparing and delivering lessons to at least 4 students at a time
* was solely responsible for assessing and reporting on the progress of those students

Originally, there was a stipulation that the roles must all be full-time (based on a 30-hour week), however, this was challenged as being potentially discriminatory to part-time teachers who may qualify in every other respect.

The new regulations require the applicant to clearly understand the types of role they can, and cannot, include. It’s important to get it right so that the assessors are not inundated with non-qualifying roles and the resulting requests for information.

The way we chose to do this was to place the key requirements upfront with a check-box declaration at the top of the form for each role the applicant chooses to submit. They must check the box to move on through the journey, and in doing so, confirm that they understand the criteria that all submitted roles must satisfy.

### Duration of work experience
In terms of role duration, applicants need to have worked for a minimum of 9 months, spent actively teaching, across 1 academic year. If they demonstrate more than 9 months but under 20 (the equivalent of 2 academic years) an award of QTS will also require the applicant to undergo a 2-year statutory induction period. No induction period is required for those with more than 20 months.

In practice, we decided not to present applicants with the duration requirements in both months and academic years, as it would result in confusion. The figures in months are effectively a translation of 1-2 academic years, which the assessors need to assess the application. But for applicants, it's simpler to present the requirements in months only.

Using months also allows us to build the service to give the applicant a running total of what they’ve entered so far. That’s particularly important when it comes to part-time roles. When the decision was taken to include part-time roles, it raised the potential for many variants.

For example, someone who worked 2 days per week for 3 years would satisfy the 9-month requirement, but so would someone who worked 1 day per fortnight for 11 years. For that reason we decided to replace the “Was this role full time or part time?” approach, instead asking “Approximately how many hours per week did you work in this role?”.

The system will keep a running total of the hours entered, translating them into our agreed definition of a month.

This approach brings one more complication – applicants entering part-time roles may see a running total that shows fewer months than they expected.

That’s because we need to condense part-time experience into full months, based on the 30-hour week standard we use for a ‘full time’ position. For example, someone entering a role where they worked 15 hours per week for 18 months, would see a running total of 9 months, because the system translates what they've entered into 30-hour weeks, and from there into a number of months.

For that reason, we iterated the design shown in the screenshot above, replacing it with the one below, where we clearly explain to applicants entering part-time roles why their running total may seem lower than expected.
