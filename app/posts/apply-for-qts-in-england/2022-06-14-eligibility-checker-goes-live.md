The key piece of design and content work this sprint was going live with the first iteration of the Qualified teacher Status (QTS) eligibility checker.

It went online on Tuesday 21 June and it’s there to improve the experience for overseas teachers. But it’ll also save the assessors a lot of time from sifting through ineligible applications and having to ask for additional information.

At the same time, we went live with our [analytics dashboard](https://apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/performance)
, which tells us how many times the checker has been used, the countries that people are applying from and how many of those users got a successful outcome (meaning they can, if they choose, progress to making a full application).

While the checker is live and in use, we’ve been conducting a round of user research and we’ll be iterating in the near future.


#### ‘The application form’

The other big piece of work this sprint saw us turning our attention to the application form itself.

In recent weeks we’ve been developing the ‘buckets’ approach, which delivers users into one of 6 journeys, depending on the country and/or territory that they’re recognised in.

The idea is to serve them only the information that’s relevant to their circumstances, so they don’t need to wade through content that does not directly apply to them.

We started working on ‘bucket 4’, with Spain as an example, because that particular journey is the most complex variant with regard to the evidence they need to provide.

In a bucket 4 country, it’s not possible to verify the applicant’s status as a teacher online, so they need to provide a written statement from the country’s competent authority.

It’s also not possible to verify online that they have no sanctions on their record, so they need to provide us with a work history. We’re currently testing the proposed bucket 4 route with users. As it’s the most complicated route, in theory once we get it right, it should be easier to build out the other bucket routes.



#### ‘Finding the service’

We requested (and were granted) some basic changes to the GOV.UK and TRA pages that give users guidance on what QTS is and who it’s for.

The main GOV.UK [landing page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk#apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts) for QTS applicants who trained outside the UK now links directly to the eligibility checker as does the [TRA landing page](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk)
