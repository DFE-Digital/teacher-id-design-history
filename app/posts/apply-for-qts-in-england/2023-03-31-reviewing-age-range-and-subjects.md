The need for applicants to provide information about the age range and subjects they can teach is one of the key requirements that was carried over into the new regulations for qualified teacher status (QTS).

However, with the expansion of the process into types of verification requests that occur after the initial assessment recommendation, we needed to revisit how the interaction works so that assessors can factor in new information and make a final decision.

### User needs being met

* As an assessor I need to be able to review and edit the applicant’s age range and subjects information during initial assessment, so that their application reflects the age range and recognised subjects that the applicant can teach in England.

* As an assessor I need to be able to review and edit my initial take on the applicant’s age range and subjects information, prior to awarding QTS, to factor in any new information learned at the verification stage.

### The existing age range and subjects interaction

For the version of the Apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England service that went live in November 2022, we’d already designed the case management system to play back what the applicant entered in response to the questions about age range and subjects.


As with the other sections of the initial assessment, the existing interaction for age range and subjects plays back the information to the assessor, along with a checklist and the option to request further information or decline the application by selecting a reason and adding a note.

In this interaction, they can also edit the age range and/or the subject information if they need to, again leaving a note to explain what they’ve changed and why.

### The new approach &ndash; interactions at initial assessment and before awarding

In testing with assessors, we learned that there was already a tendency to complete any tweaks to information about the applicant’s age range and subjects as a last step, just before awarding QTS.

To add to that, assessing applications under the new regulations involves verifying references (and potentially qualifications and letters of professional standing) after the initial assessment recommendation. That means an assessor may well need to amend the age range and subjects again, in light of any new information received from these post-initial-assessment verifications.

In short, while we’ve retained the interaction shown above, we also needed to build in the ability for assessors to have their own initial thoughts on age range and subjects played back to them, just before awarding, with the opportunity to make any final checks and edits.


### Visually distinguishing the two interactions from one another

Initial thinking led us to simply replicate the initial assessment version of the age range and subjects interaction, presenting it to the assessor in the same format, as a last step before awarding.

However, there were 2 issues with this approach.

1. What the assessor actually needs to see at this point is their own initial recommendations on age range and subjects played back to them (rather than what the applicant originally submitted).


2. Having exactly the same interaction repeated at this point was confusing for assessors, as it was not immediately clear that it’s a different, final check, rather than a return to the original interaction.

We decided to develop a new interaction formatted around the standard ‘Check your answers’ template that we use elsewhere in the service. As well as looking different to the initial assessment interaction, it gives us the chance to use slightly different language at this point too, for example ‘Confirm age range and subjects’ instead of ‘Verify age range and subjects’, to distinguish the interactions from one another. That helps to set the scene for the assessor to revisit their own initial recommendations.

Should the assessor need to make any changes, they can use the ‘Change‘ links, which take them back to a page that looks similar to the initial assessment interaction, but has an updated title and does not feature the initial checklist or further information and decline reasons.

Again, this helps to reinforce understanding that this is a last piece of housekeeping before awarding QTS, rather than a return to the initial assessment section.
