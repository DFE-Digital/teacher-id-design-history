  title: Unlocking Teacher Self-Service Portal accounts

Many people use Find a Lost TRN to access their DQT record via the [Teacher Self Service Portal](). 

TSSP accounts that were created before 2014 and haven't been used are locked by default. At present, the only way to unlock your account is to contact the TRA helpdesk. 

This means that many of our users still have to contact the helpdesk after retrieving their TRN to finish their task.

## Automatic account unlocking

When we have matched someone to a TRN, we will set their record to unlocked automatically if:
- it is locked,
- it doesn't have any alerts (we can't unlock records with alerts relating to prohibitions, because people who are prohibited have their TRN published to GOV.UK, so anyone could access their record through the portal), and
- the email address given has not been used to find another TRN

If an email address has been used in the past to find another TRN, we will still allow the TRN to be sent out to that email address but won't unlock the TSSP account. We will also log the email address, so that we can contact these users to find out more about their need to look up multiple people's TRNs.

## Screening people who are using Find a lost TRN on behalf of someone else

Paul to explain - we've decided not to do this because it would be acknowledging that you can do this even though we've said you can't/shouldn't

## Screening people who aren't trying to access TSSP

Paul to explain - not doing it, too difficult
