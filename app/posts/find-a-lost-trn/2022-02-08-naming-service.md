We changed the service name to Find a lost TRN.

Previously it was known as one of:

- Find your TRN
- Find out your TRN
- Find my TRN

We still need to test this service name with users.

## Why we chose Find a lost TRN

By including ‘lost’ it makes it clear that our service is for recovering existing TRNs, not generating new ones.

By using neutral pronouns we do not need to set the context of ‘you’ or ‘my’. It allows for the possibility of someone finding a TRN on behalf of someone else – consider an assisted digital helper. The ‘Renew your passport’ service changed name to ‘Apply for a passport’ for similar reasons.

This name matches a pattern of similar pages on GOV.UK:

- [Find a lost National Insurance number](https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number)
- [Find a lost UTR number](https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number)

Users searching for both "find TRN" and "lost TRN" will identify with this service name.
