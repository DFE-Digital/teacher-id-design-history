  title: Understanding and meeting assessor user needs

Assessment of the applications that teachers submit for QTS are carried out by a small team of assessors at the Coventry-based Teacher Qualifications Unit at the TRA.

The current case management system  cannot be scaled up for the new service as it does not meet the assessors user needs for:
- complete applications (data and documents) presented in a structured and accessible that it is easy to navigate way for assessors to view and make their decisions against
- managing knowledge and case history

It also does not meet the TRA’s needs for:
- business resilience -  it currently takes an assessor a year to train to assess cases
- robust and good quality data - to enable monitoring, evaluation, trend /insight generation, audit, reporting, risk management and service iterations 
- detailed and structured case history information for use in appeals
- meeting legal duties around accessibility

We built on initial work from discovery, and worked with assessors and the management team to organise and prioritise their user needs and frustrations.

Taking the user needs as the backbone, we put together a service map to provide design direction through an holistic view across internal and external systems.

Further to this, we then created ‘proof of concept’ wireframes for a new internal case management service to help us with roadmapping and to estimate beta team resources. 

These have not yet been tested with assessors.
