Anyone with a Teacher Reference Number (TRN) has access to the Teacher Self Service Portal.

## Who has a TRN?

TRNs are not just for qualified teachers. There are 5 reasons someone may be given a TRN:

The complete set of people who have TRNs therefore looks like this:

## Who should have a TRN in future?

In the future, the TRA aims to reduce allocation of TRNs to qualified teachers, and find other ways to share data about people who aren't qualified teachers when we need to which doesn't involve giving them a TRN - for example using [Get an identity to access Teacher Services]().

We aim to reduce the reasons someone can be given a TRN:

More research with key users of the TRN such as the Teachers Pension Service (TPS) and Teacher Analysis Division (TAD) is needed to confirm that this is the right solution. 

There is no intention to remove TRNs from people who already have them (this wouldn't be possible even it was desirable) so the set of people who have TRNs will remain the same.

## TRN holders' needs from the Teacher Self Service Portal

More user research is needed to understand what the different types of people who can currently access the Teacher Self Service Portal need from the TRA, especially as the scope of the TRN is reduced.
