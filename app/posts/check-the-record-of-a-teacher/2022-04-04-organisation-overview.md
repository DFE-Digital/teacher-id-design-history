There are 2 portals:

1. [School portal](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/school-overview/) – for nurseries, schools, academies, free schools, independent schools and colleges
2. Organisation portal – for teacher supply agencies, local authorities and training providers

This overview covers the organisation portal. Users access this portal via DfE Sign-in, using the service named ‘Teacher Services: Employer Access - Agent’.

There is a [page of guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-status-checks-information-for-employers) which describes how to access the service and what you can use it for. The GOV.UK guidance refers to the portal as ‘Teacher Services’.

The organisation portal has these features:

- a teacher lookup using TRN and date of birth
- lists of people with teaching restrictions
- a page showing an individual teacher’s details, [sharing a similar layout to the self-service home page](/overview/#signed-in-home-page)

It includes the following lists:

- teachers who have failed to successfully complete their induction or probation period
- teachers who are the subject of a suspension or conditional order imposed by the General Teaching Council for England (prior to its abolition in 2012)
- teachers and others who are prohibited from teaching in England
- [individuals who have been barred from taking part in the management of an independent school](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barring-unsuitable-individuals-from-managing-independent-schools) (including academies and free schools) – section 128 legislation
- teachers sanctioned in other EEA states used to be shown, but the list is no longer maintained, though the link remains
