We currently show a tag for every search result and on every teacher record. This tag says either “restrictions” or “no restrictions”.

We show the restrictions tag if the person:

- failed their induction or probation
- is prevented from teaching by a prohibition order
- was sanctioned by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE)
- is on the children’s barred list

We show the no restrictions tag if none of these apply.

We’ve decided to remove the no restrictions tag since it could confuse users.

For example, a person cannot teach if they have not yet completed their induction. We would not consider them to have a restriction but it could be misleading to use the phrase “no restrictions”.

In addition we know from research that users are looking out for reasons why they should not employ someone. Removing the no restrictions tag should make the restrictions tag stand out more, since most records will not have a tag.

## Further considerations

We’ll look at whether there are any other things we should highlight in the teacher record, such as whether someone:

- has qualified teacher status
- passed their induction

If we do decide to highlight anything else, we may do it by adding new tags.
