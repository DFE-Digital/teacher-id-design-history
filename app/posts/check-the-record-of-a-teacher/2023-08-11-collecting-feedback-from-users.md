We’ll allow users to give feedback through a link in the phase banner at the top of every page of the service.

## How it works

Clicking ‘feedback’ in the phase banner takes users to the feedback form.

There are 3 questions:

- How satisifed are you with the service?
- How can we improve the service?
- Can we contact you about your feedback?

Users must answer all 3 questions before they can send their feedback.

### How satisifed are you with the service?

We’re asking for this so that we can track the satisfaction score. The options are:

- Very satisfied
- Satisfied
- Neither satisfied or dissatisfied
- Dissatisifed
- Very dissatisfied

### How can we improve the service?

We’re asking for this so that we can understand the problems users are having.

### Can we contact you about your feedback?

We’re asking for this so that we can contact users about their feedback and invite them to participate in user research.

The options are:

- Yes
- No

Selecting ‘Yes’ reveals an email address field. The user must fill it in before they can send their feedback.

### Sending feedback

Clicking ‘Send feedback’ takes users to the confirmation page.

There’s a link which allows users to return to the report serious misconduct start page.

## Further considerations

We’d like to consider:

- tracking which page the user was on when they went to give feedback
- whether we should associate the user details with the their feedback in order to add context to the feedback
