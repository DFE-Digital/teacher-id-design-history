In this service, a teacher’s record does not say if they:

- have Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status
- are prevented from managing or governing schools

Someone with QTLS status is allowed to teach as long as they’re also a member of the Society for Education and Training (SET).

The DfE does not keep a list of people with QTLS. Users need to check the SET professional register.

Only around 30 people are prevented from managing or governing schools. They're often described as being on the section 128 list.

This list is currently available in the Employer Access service. We’ve decided not to include it in the new service because:

- many people on the list are not teachers, so they should not appear in a service giving access to teachers’ records
- the list is also available on GOV.UK, so we can link to it

## What we changed

We’ve added headings for QTLS and section 128 to the sign in page. Under each heading there’s a short description and a link to the place where users can find more information.

The new content is below the green sign in button, since it will not be relevant to most searches which users carry out.

## Further considerations

We intend to include QTLS status in the service in future. This depends on us getting the data from SET and being able to keep it up to date.

If we do include QTLS status in a teacher’s record then we’ll remove the content about it from the sign in page.
