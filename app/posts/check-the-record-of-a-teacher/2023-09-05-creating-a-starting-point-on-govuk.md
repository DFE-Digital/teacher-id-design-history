All government services must have a starting point on GOV.UK once they enter the public beta phase. This is when the service is available to anyone eligible to use it, rather than only being offered to certain users.

Since this service is for use by specialists, the starting point will be in the Whitehall section of GOV.UK.

This means that the page will be written and published by the Teaching Regulation Agency and Department for Education. The Government Digital Service will not be involved.

The page will tell users:

- that the service can be used by schools, colleges, teacher supply agencies and local authorities
- that a teacher’s record includes their qualifictions and any restrictions which might affect their employment as a teacher
- how to get access to the service if they do not already have an account

The page also has:

- a start button which takes users to the [service sign in page](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/telling-users-what-the-service-does/)
- links to related content on GOV.UK

Pages on GOV.UK are gathered into topics and collections, to help users find what they’re looking for. This page will be part of the teacher records topic and the qualified teacher status collection.

## Further considerations

This page will not be published immediately. The service must first go through a private beta phase, where we invite people to use it rather than making it publicly available.

Before we publish the page, we’ll need to discuss the content with:

- people within the Teaching Regulation Agency
- the Department for Education digital communications team, who will peer review and publish the content

We may make changes to the page based on these conversations.

We’ll also consider deleting the current [Teacher Services page](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/). Several services linked to from that page already have starting points on GOV.UK and we plan to create starting points for the others.
