At the moment, users see the task list with their previous referral when they sign back into their account. They have the ability to make changes and send the referral again which does not make sense.

## What we changed

### Adding an overview page and referral details page

We added an overview page that shows sent referrals and any draft referrals.

Clicking on a sent referral will show a read-only version. We also added contact details for the TRA if users need to make any changes.

### Adding a link from the confirmation page to the referral details page

We added a link from the confirmation page to the referral details page to make users aware that they can view this.

### Changing the summary cards to summary lists

We changed all the summary cards to summary lists because we do not think summary cards are useful here.

### Changing the task list h1 heading to ‘Your referral’

We changed the h1 heading from ‘Your allegation of serious misconduct’ to ‘Your referral’. This means the content is more concise and consistent with other pages, for example:

- ‘Your referrals’ - the h1 heading on the overview page
- ‘Agree and send referral’ - the button text on the check answers page

### Removing the numbers from the sections of the form

At the moment we use numbered headings for:

- About you
- About the teacher
- The allegation

We removed them because they imply that the tasks must be completed in a particular order.

## Further considerations

At the moment, we’re not stopping a user from making multiple referrals as a member of the public or an employer.

We do not think that a user would ever need to do this. We’ll consider ways to make sure this is clear to a user making a second referral.
