We designed a way for users to delete their referral before they send it.

But we have decided to remove it because:

- we’re going to automatically delete draft referrals after a period of time
- we’ll send users reminders to complete their referral
- we do not think that users will do this by the time they end up on this page

We considered adding content to explain the circumstances in which the referral will be deleted. But we decided not to because:

- we do not have any evidence that it’s needed
- we do not want to distract users with something that they’re unlikely to need

After launch, we’ll monitor how often users request their referral to be deleted.aa
