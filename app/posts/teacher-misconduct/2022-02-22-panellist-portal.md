Unlike the other people outside of the TMU who are involved in the misconduct process, [panellists](/teacher-misconduct/users/#panellists) have direct access to the TMS via the Panellist Portal.

The panellist portal allows panellists to:

- provide unavailability for hearings
- view their upcoming hearings
- view and upload documents

## Provide unavailability

The panellists can provide their unavailability for hearings, through the portal. This ensures that they are not booked in for hearings, by the scheduling team, when they are not available. The user is also able to download their unavailability in an Excel spreadsheet.

## View upcoming hearings

The portal allows the panellists to view all the cases for which they are panellists. The following can be viewed on the portal:
- hearings
- case management hearings
- set aside hearings
- induction appeal hearings

## Upload documents

The panellist is able to view TRA documentation that exists on the portal. The panellist can upload relevant documents to share with case workers. The panellist is unable to delete any documents that are on the portal, this includes documents that they uploaded themselves.

The documents shown to the panellist are not the same as the TMS case docs. To make the appropriate documents available to the panellists, the case manager needs to download the right files from the case record in TMS and upload them to each panellist contact record in the panellist portal.
