We made some changes to the page users see if they enter an expired confirmation code.

We changed the h1 heading from ‘There was a problem signing in’ to ‘Your confirmation code has expired’.

We changed the paragraph from ‘Your security code has expired. Try again.’ to ‘You need to [request a new confirmation code]’.

We removed the ‘Continue’ button because the link is now in the paragraph.
