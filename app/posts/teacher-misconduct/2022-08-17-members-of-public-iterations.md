  title: Reporting misconduct, iterations for members of the public
  date: 2022-08-17

Following on from the [initial designs for members of the public](/teacher-misconduct/variations-for-members-of-the-public/), we've made some iterations.

## If they haven’t followed local procedures

We told users they needed to complain first. That’s what we’d like them to do, but strictly speaking they don't have to, and in some cases that could be ok.

We’ve reworded the page to give an option of continuing without making an informal complaint.

## Being clear about the declaration up front

At the end of the report we ask users to sign a declaration. Users told us this would be useful to know earlier.

We've added a page at the end of the eligibility screener that outlines:

- that as a result of their report, a teacher could be prohibited from teaching
- they may need to attend a panel
- their name and allegation will be shared with the teacher, but not their contact details
- submitted data is kept for 50 years

## How personal data is used

Members of the public are rightly wary about their contact details being shared with the person they are reporting.

Before they give us any of their own details we now make it clear what is shared, and how their information is used.
