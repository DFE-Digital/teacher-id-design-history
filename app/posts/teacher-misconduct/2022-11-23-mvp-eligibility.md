## What has gone live

- Eligibilty checker to determine whether the referral is from an employer or member of the public
- Links to specific downloadable forms depending on whether public or employer
- Incorporated step by step guidance within the start of the journey

## Why is it different to the initial plan?

We made the decision to deliver a smaller part of the service early so that we can gather feedback, get a stable platform and look to deliver other parts of the service in an iterative method.

## How it works

You can refer an allegation to TRA if it relates to anyone undertaking teaching work within a relevant establishment as outlined within The Teachers' Desciplinary(England) Regulations 2012 (the Regulations).
There are two different journeys, one for employers and one for members of the public.
There are a series of knockout questions that direct users to the right information, these are early in the journey to allow users to fail fast.
We link to an offline form that is specific to the type of user eg employer or member of the public. 

## What comes next?

We have 2 stages that will be developed next.

- The employer flow is the first to be developed. It is the larger of the two flows with the most complexity
- The public flow will follow and will reuse many of the employer flow pages
- A secure way to continue an existing referral
- Integration with the case management system
