Before a user sends their referral, we [show them the declaration](/teacher-misconduct/changing-the-declration-page).

This declaration tells users what they are agreeing to by sending their referral. For example, that all their answers are true to the best of their knowledge and belief.

At the moment, the declaration:

- says ‘will’ when we mean ‘may’
- includes references to getting ‘permission from third parties’ that users found ambiguous
- says ‘your referral will be kept on file for 50 years’ when legally it should be ‘up to 50 years’

So we changed the content to make it clearer and simpler.
