title: Changing the way we talk about who processes referrals
date: 2023-01-25

When talking about the people who process referrals, at the moment we use a combination of:

- ‘the Teacher Regulation Agency’
- ‘the TRA’
- ‘we’

But this could be unclear, especially as users are likely to be unfamiliar with the service and might only ever use it once.

So we changed the content throughout to be clear and consistent.

## Examples

### Changing the start page

When introducing the service, we mentioned ‘The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)’.

However, using too many different acronyms and department names could be confusing.

Also, we already tell users what the service allows them to do in the service name: ‘Refer serious misconduct by a teacher in England’.

So we removed this.

### Changing the footer

When signposting users to get help, we said: ‘We’ll aim to respond in 3 working days’.

But ‘we’ could refer to more than one organisation. For example, a legal firm helping to investigate a case.

So we changed this to: ‘You’ll get a response within 3 working days.’

### Changing hint text

We included hint text for users when giving their personal details, such as phone number. For example: ‘The TRA will only use this to contact you about your referral.’

To make the content easier to read, we removed the acronym and changed it to: ‘It’ll only be used to contact you about your referral.’
