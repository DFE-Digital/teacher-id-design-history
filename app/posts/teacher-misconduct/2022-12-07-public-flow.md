## What is the public flow?
The public flow is a specific series of screens where members of the public can make a referral about a teacher if they believe that serious misconduct has occured. It is created on the back of the [full employer journey](/teacher-misconduct/report-serious-misconduct-by-a-teacher) that we previously posted about and we've reused a vast majority of the screens where possible.

## How does a member of the public use this service?

The public flow tries to help a member of the public to go through the correct procedures if they want to make a referral by asking if they have already contacted the school, governers or the local council.

The referall process should not be the first step in the process and this is reflected in the public flow. Later in the journey we ask for evidence to support the process the member of public has followed so this is a crucial question to avoid confusion and wasted time further in the journey.

## What information do we collect from a member of the public?

The create a referral from a member of the public the key pieces of information we need are: 

- The name, email and a contact number of the person making the referral
- The name of the teacher the referral is about
- Some basic details about the teacher such are their role, any other duties and the school they worked for
- Details about the allegations and some background information on the case so far
- Any evidence or documents that support the case

## What information have we removed from the public flow?

We had already removed some key employer information such as National Insurance number and previous allegations but after a review of the questions as a team and with the case workers we we're able to reduce the information gathering a step further.

We had seen some struggles with users understanding the information being asked for and together with the case workers we felt that there was a risk that incorrect information could be used which would cause issues with the case later on. The case workers contact the school and the correct information can be gathered at this stage.

- Reduced the contact details for the member of public to just a main contact number rather than 4 options
- We don't need the teachers age/date of birth
- We don't need any of the teachers contact details such as email or main contact number
- Removed the allegation summary as this was confusing during user research


## The task list
![Task list](public-tasks.png "Task list")

Using the same task list process as the employer flow we can break up the journey for a member of the public so that they don't need to complete the referral in one sitting by allowing them to return and complete on another day.

There is also a check your answers at the end of each section so that users can review or state that they need to come back to the section.

## Making it clear what happens with a referral
![How your details will be used](how-your-details-will-be-used.png "How your details will be used")

The member of the public needs to be aware that their name will be used as part of the referral and the teacher will be informed as well.

We need to be sure that members of the public are aware of how their name will be used so we will be monitoring the analytics on this page to check for any drop offs. Large drop offs will tell us that users have not seen or understood the process and we will need to iterate on the elegibility part of the journey.

## What are the risks in simplifying the public flow?

We considered that there are risks on making this flow too simple and quick for a member of the public to fill in. We know that a case worker only needs to know the following to create a case:
- name of the teacher 
- name of the school where the teacher worked
- name and contact details about the referrer
- some details about the allegation

We tried a few variations such as removing the task list and creating a linear journey but we also felt that making it too easy might cause issues such as unneccessary referrals so we have struck a balance that we will review through research and when the service is available for the public to use.

## What's next?

We are planning to test the updated public flows through user research and iterate where needed.

We need to keep a close eye on new cases that are created so we will be working closely with the case workers to understand whether there are any gaps or issues causes with the public flow that we need to improve.
