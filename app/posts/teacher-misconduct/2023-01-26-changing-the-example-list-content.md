When asking what the allegation is about, we give users the option of viewing some examples of serious misconduct. For example, a criminal offence that results in imprisonment.

At the moment, this list may cause problems because it contains:

- ‘and/or’ phrases, which can be inaccessible for screen readers and other assistive technology
- lots of clauses and brackets, which can be difficult to scan

So we changed the content to make it accessible and easier to read.
