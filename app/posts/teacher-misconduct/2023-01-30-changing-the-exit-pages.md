title: Changing the exit pages
date: 2023-01-30

---

At the start of the service, we ask users a series of questions to [find out if they're eligible](/teacher-misconduct/mvp-eligibility).

If a user is not eligible, we show them a series of ‘exit’ pages telling them what to do next. For example, make an informal complaint first.

At the moment, some of the content on the pages includes:

- long headers
- information already shown on previous pages
- broken links

So we changed the content to make it clearer and simpler.


## What we changed

###  If the user has not already made a complaint

We ask members of the public: ‘Have you already made a complaint to the school, school governors or your local council?’

If the user selects ‘no’, we take them to an exit page telling them to make a complaint first.

We changed the page by:

- turning the H1 heading into bullet points to make it easier to read
- re-wording the H1 heading from ‘You need to make a complaint first’ to ‘Consider making a complaint first’ to make it more accurate
- removing ‘you’ll need proof to support your complaint’, as this information is already included on the page link

### If the allegation is not about a teacher

We ask both employers and members of the public: ‘Is the allegation about a teacher?’

If they select ‘no’ or ‘I’m not sure’, we ask if the person carried out unsupervised teaching work.

If the user selects ‘no’, we take them to an exit page telling them they cannot use this service.

We changed the page by:

- removing the guidance about what counts as ‘unsupervised teaching work’, as we already cover this on the previous page
- making the H1 more specific (‘You cannot use this service to refer someone who is not a teacher’) - we already have exit pages covering other scenarios

### If the teacher was not employed in England

We ask both employers and members of the public: ‘Were they employed in England at the time the alleged misconduct took place?’

If the user selects ‘no’, we take them to an exit page telling the user they cannot refer a teacher who was not employed in England.

We changed the page by:

- making the H1 shorter and clearer: ‘You cannot refer a teacher who was not employed in England’
- fixing the broken links
