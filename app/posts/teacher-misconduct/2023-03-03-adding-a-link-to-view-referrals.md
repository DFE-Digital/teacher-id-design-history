We previously added the ability to [view sent referrals and make another referral](/teacher-misconduct/viewing-sent-referrals-and-making-another-referral).

But if a user makes another referral or continues a referral that’s in progress, they cannot get back to the overview page.

So we added a ‘Your referrals’ link to the navigation menu at the top.

It’ll only be shown after a user sends their first referral.
