At the moment, users do not have a clear and consistent way of getting help throughout the service.

## What we changed

We updated the information to:

- give both email and phone options
- set expectations about response times - ‘We aim to respond within 3 working days’
- make it clear when help is and is not available - ‘Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (except public holidays)’
