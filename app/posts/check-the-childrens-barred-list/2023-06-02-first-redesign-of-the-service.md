title: First redesign of the service
date: 2023-06-02

Agencies and schools can currently [check if someone appears on the Children’s Barred List within the employer access service](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/dbs-standalone-barred-list-search/).

We decided to split out this service because the Children’s Barred List is only used:

- if the employer is waiting on the result of a DBS check for a new employee
- to check the status of an employee who worked at a school or college less than 3 months ago

## How it works

Users sign in using DfE Sign-in.

Once signed in they can search by the candidate’s last name and date of birth.

If the candidate is a possible match, then the user is told to contact DBS.

If the candidate is not a match, then the user is told that no record has been found.

## Further considerations

We’re not sure if the name of the service clearly describes what users are trying to do. We’d like to do research to confirm this.
