At the moment, agencies and schools can [check if someone appears on the Children’s Barred List within the employment check portal](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/dbs-standalone-barred-list-search/).

We decided to split out this service because the Children’s Barred List is checked under certain circumstances and for people being employed for roles other than teachers.

## How it works

### Signing in

Users will sign in with their DfE Sign-in account.

### Searching for the candidate

Once signed in they can search by the candidate’s last name and date of birth.

If the candidate is a possible match, then the user is told to contact DBS.

If the candidate is not a match, then the user is told that no record has been found.
