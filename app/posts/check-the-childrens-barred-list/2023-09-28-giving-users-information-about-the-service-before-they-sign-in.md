The service will only be given a start page on GOV.UK once it’s publicly available.

When we invite people to use the service during the private beta phase, we’ll send them a link to a sign in page.

This sign in page will tell users:

- what the children’s barred list is
- what types of organisations can check the list
- under what circumstances a user is allowed to check if someone is on the list
- what information a user will need to check if someone is on the list

## Further considerations

We’ll still need a sign in page once the service has a start page on GOV.UK. This is because for technical reasons we cannot link straight from GOV.UK to DfE Sign-in.

We’ll need to decide how to split content between the start page and sign in page.
