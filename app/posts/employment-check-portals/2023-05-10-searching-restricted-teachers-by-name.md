At the moment, users search the restricted list by using the CMD+F shortcut and typing in the candidateâ€™s last name.

This only works because the list includes every teacher on one page.

But loading all teachers on one page slows down the page load time. So we added pagination. But this means users can no longer use the shortcut without clicking through each page.

So we added a search box which searches the entire list.
