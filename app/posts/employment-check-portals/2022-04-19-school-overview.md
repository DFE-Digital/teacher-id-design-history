There are 2 portals:

1. School portal – for nurseries, schools, academies, free schools, independent schools and colleges
2. [Organisation portal](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/organisation-overview/) – for teacher supply agencies, local authorities and training providers

This overview covers the school portal. Users access this portal via DfE Sign-in, using the service named ‘Teacher Services: Employer Access - Schools’.

There is a [page of guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-status-checks-information-for-employers) which describes how to access the service and what you can use it for. The GOV.UK guidance refers to the portal as ‘Teacher Services’.

## Managing a list of teachers

In addition to all of the features of the [organisation portal](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/organisation-overview/), the school portal lets users:

- maintain a list of teachers
- ‘claim’ new teachers (add to list)
- ‘disown’ old teachers (remove from list)
