We initially [gave users 4 separate restricted lists](/check-the-record-of-a-teacher/a-more-basic-redesign-of-the-service/):

- Banned from teaching by the Secretary of State for Education
- Failed induction or probation
- Sanctioned by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE)
- Banned or restricted from managing independent schools

But research with agencies showed that because the names of the lists do not exactly match what is  in the current service, some users were not immediately sure which list was which.

Also, having separate lists means that users have to view each list to make sure that the candidate does not appear on them.

So we combined the lists into one ‘Restricted teachers’ list.
