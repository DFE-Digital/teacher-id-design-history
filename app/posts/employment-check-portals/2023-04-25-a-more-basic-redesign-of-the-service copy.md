We previously redesigned the service to be clearer and simpler to use.

But we have struggled to arrange research. And without research we're not confident about using this design.

So in the meantime, we've created a more basic version that's aligned with the existing service.

This allows us to start development while running research at the same time.

We'll then iterate as we find out the user needs.

## How it works

### Finding a teacher by teacher reference number (TRN)

When the user signs in, they'll see a search form.

If the TRN is valid it will take the user to the record.

If the TRN is invalid it will take the user to a page saying the record was not found.

### Viewing teachers in your organisation

Teachers that have been added to the user's organisation are shown below the search form.

If the user clicks on a teacher, they'll view the teacher's record.

### Viewing teachers on restricted lists

At the bottom of the main page, there are 4 restricted lists of teachers.

If the user clicks one of the restricted lists, they'll be taken to a page showing a list of teachers with that restriction. For example, if a teacher has failed their probation or induction.

We removed the 'Teachers sanctioned in other EEA member states' list because it's no longer needed.

We also renamed the lists to make them clearer and more plain English.
