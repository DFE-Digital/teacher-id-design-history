At the moment, users have to perform 2 different searches to:

- check the record (by TRN)
- check if the teacher has restrictions (by name and date of birth)

This is long winded, unnecessary and adds complexity to the experience.

So weâ€™ve changed this so that users only have to perform a single search by name and date of birth.
