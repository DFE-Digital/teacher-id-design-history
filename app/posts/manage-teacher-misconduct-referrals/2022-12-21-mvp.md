At the moment, people make [referrals of serious misconduct by a teacher by sending a form by email](#).

Caseworkers access a shared mailbox to open up new referrals. They open up the referral and move the details and any evidence attached into the TMS CRM.

As we’re going to allow people to [make referrals online](#), we need to give caseworkers a way to access the referrals.

## How it works

When someone makes a referral, an email notification will be sent to the shared mailbox.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD025 MD001 -->
{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Jo Swan has been referred",
  content: "

Jo Swan has been referred for serious misconduct by a teacher.
