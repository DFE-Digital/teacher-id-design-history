We mocked up a version of the [GOV.UK TRN guidance page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn):

* as an entry point to the Find my TRN service in user research
* to get users to compare the online option to the phone support option.

## Changes to the original guidance

The Find my TRN service collects the exact same info as the email one did, and sends a response by email, so we see it as a direct replacement to the email inbox. Consequently:

* we replaced the TRA helpdesk email inbox reference with a big green button link to the Find my TRN digital service
* we changed the language from "request a reminder by email or phone" to "find out your TRN online or by phone".

The online option prompts the user to have their National Insurance number ready, although strictly speaking the service can be completed without it in many cases.
